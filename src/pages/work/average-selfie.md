Meet Avery, the average selfie! The idea to create Avery (an average selfie) came to me while I was sifting through hundreds of thousands of selfies posted on Instagram during my MFA Thesis research. The goal going into this data research was to find patterns, trends, and — in general — be inspired to create new ways we can understand the quantum amounts of data being shared online each day.

Projects like [Google's "Average" typeface](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Average#standard-styles) provided inspiration. As I continued observing I began to wonder what would emerge if someone were able to harvest an acceptable amount of selfies and make use of technology to morph/average all of the samples into a singular likeness.

Wonder no more because it happened! By creating a cloud based aggregation function built on top of the public Instagram API I was able to make use of Artificial Intelligence to take four sample sets and create averages of their forms. I hope you enjoy the results below.

In order to make this slightly more scientific and quantifiable I placed a few parameters on when I would gather data and how often. My hopes is this would give some variation on the data sets (as to weed out anomalous moments of data) and bring variety into the faces, places, and times that people were posting their selfies.

## Data Set 01

After the first data sample was complete (so exciting) I was ready to run some AI model magic and merge the selfies into one! Below is the first appearance of Avery, the average of selfie faces on Instagram.

## Data Set 02

Data sample number two! This second set was quite exciting as you can start to see. Based on the first two average selfies it is beginning to seem that potentially — no matter the time a data sample is collected — given enough selfie samples the average form will be quite similar.

## Data Set 03

Data sample number three. Here you can see there are definitely variations in the "exactness" in the facial features. But, still quite similar overall. It looks as though there really may be a singular "Avery" who will always peak through as the average of all faces.

## Data Set 04

The fourth and last data set for this little experiment. Again, some slight variation in form but — to me — it looks like they could all be siblings.

## Conclusion

I believe this experiment gives further validity to the notion that there are many creative, and unexplored, ways to present the growing flow of data we are generating and collecting online. The suggested implications are that the emergence of new ways to consume data can provide improved clarity and insight to the data we have at hand. More clarity means a chance for increased knowledge and better informed decisions.

This project shows potential to be expanded in its scope. Potential modes of expansion would be variations like gathering larger data sets to average, isolating demographics, or making creative use of the many other data points accessible on the public Instagram API (or other publicly accessible social network datas).
