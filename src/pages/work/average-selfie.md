Meet Avery, the average selfie! This project is an extension of my MFA Thesis work in which I focused on the phenomenon of ubiquitous online social networking, evaluating its uses and potential effects on its users, and presenting findings and creative solutions to allow stakeholders to engage the data in novel ways.

The idea to create Avery (an average selfie) came to me while I was sifting through hundreds of thousands of selfies posted on Instagram. My goal going into this data research was to find patterns, trends, and — in general — be inspired to create new ways to browse and understand the quantum amounts of data being shared online each day. Projects like [Google's "Average" typeface](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Average#standard-styles) provided inspiration as I wondered what would emerge if someone were able to harvest an acceptable amount of selfies and apply some sort of technology to morph and averaging all of the samples into a singular likeness.

Wonder no more because it happened! By creating a cloud based aggregation function built on top of the public Instagram API I was able to make use of AI to take these sample sets and create averages. I hope you enjoy the results below.

In order to make this slightly more scientific and quantifiable I placed a few parameters on when I would gather data and how often. My hopes is this would give some variation on the data sets (as to weed out anomalous moments of data) and bring variety into the faces, places, and times that people were posting their selfies.
