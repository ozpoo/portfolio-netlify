My skillset provides me with the ability to see projects of many scales all the way through — from beginning to end. The value of this comes with the rewards of enhanced communication, increased success rates, better suited solutions, and for those in a pinch — the potential to cut down costs and timeline. I believe collaboration is huge — but over the years I have found myself working for many small businesses and startups who don't have quite the financial setup to hire that big-league think tank that comes with a large team.

The path that lead me to my range of abilities stems from my restlessness when it comes to growth. Research and play have proven to serve me best in my spiritual quest for creativity. In order to serve my purpose I feel I must continue to grow both my knowledge and skillset in order to better solve — and execute — the problems I am presented.

### My Process

Stuff. Coffee is a small tree or shrub that grows in the forest understory in its wild form, and traditionally was grown commercially under other trees that provided shade. The forest-like structure of shade coffee farms provides habitat for a great number of migratory and resident species.

#### Design Thinking

My process has been greatly influenced by all fields and industries I have had the pleasure of being part of — namely — graphic design, computer engineering, and human computer interaction.

### Add the "Q&A" Stuff Here

Things like "What does your process look like?" "What topics capture your interest?" "What are your strengths?" "What are your weaknesses?"

### Thesis

Enter this into the backend as a series of posts — under the data type "thesis".

### Resume

Not sure how I want to do this yet...but seems like I need data types of "experience" and "skills"

### Services

Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.
