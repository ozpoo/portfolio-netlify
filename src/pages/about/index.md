### Add the "Q&A" Stuff Here

Things like "What does your process look like?" "What topics capture your interest?" "What are your strengths?" "What are your weaknesses?"

### Process

Coffee is a small tree or shrub that grows in the forest understory in its wild form, and traditionally was grown commercially under other trees that provided shade. The forest-like structure of shade coffee farms provides habitat for a great number of migratory and resident species.

#### Design Thinking

My process has been greatly influenced by all fields and industries I have had the pleasure of being part of — namely — graphic design, computer engineering, and human computer interaction.

### Thesis

Enter this into the backend as a series of posts — under the data type "thesis".

### Resume

Not sure how I want to do this yet...but seems like I need data types of "experience" and "skills"

### Services

Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.
