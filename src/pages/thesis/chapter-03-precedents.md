There are many works, whether they were driven through the desires of pop culture or the interest of intellectual efforts, that make use of the current status, breadth, and wild satisfaction of self generated images of one’s self seen in *selfie culture*. 

This section features a chosen set of works that explore a range of data ideas. From numbers to emotions, focus on self to focus on others, music to visual interpretation; there has been a vast interest in how we are fascinated with ourselves and the ability to easily capture our likeness and post it online for all to see. 

While many of these precedents provide a set of inspiration in terms of the context of selfie, there are also examples of functional and formal inspiration. As two of the guiding questions focused on alternative means of viewing and interacting with Online Social Networks, I was aware the creative responses would most likely take on the form of both digital and physical interactions requiring research and inspiration in both areas of materiality and function.

## 3.1. The Chainsmokers: #Selfie

“*\#Selfie*” is a socially oriented song focused on selfies created by musical group The Chainsmokers. Paired with a music video, the song is based on the conversation of two narcissistic girls at a nightclub heard discussing their night. Located in the bathroom the girls can help but take selfies in front of the mirror. The music video features selfies taken by popular celebrities such as Steve Aoki, Snoop Dogg, and David Hasselhoff, and also includes selfies submitted by fans. 

The creation of the “#*Selfie*” song and video show the integration and acceptance of Selfie Culture. The addition of celebrity selfies only forwards the idea of acceptance and hints at the selfie being a desirable activity while the addition of fan submitted selfies provides a communal platform looking past the vanity or narcissistic tendencies that may be exhibited by those who post selfies.

## 3.2. Selfiecity

Selfiecity is a website dedicated to representing selfie data. The data is a collection of selfies posted from five cities around the world. Information about demographics, poses, expressions, and visualizations of the data are presented to reveal patterns found in the collection. 

By representing data in a variety of easily digestible graphics we can start to organize what the selfie really means to different demographics. Who is posting, where, and when? What types of colors are often seen in different locations? What other corresponding tags (#) are often seen on these posts? Selfiecity shows that there really is something much more behind the visual appeal of an individual selfie.

## 3.3. Kim Kardashian: Selfish

Figure 3. Screenshot of a selfie featured in book (Kardashian West 2015) 

“*Selfish*” is a book of selfies by pop culture icon Kim Kardashian. It illustrates her life with a collection, curated by Kim, of selfies she has posted online. 

This is a testament to how integrated, acceptable, or even “*normal*” it has become to post a selfie and be proud of it. Similar to a book you may find sitting on your friend’s coffee table that exhibits famous historical paintings, you now may find Kim’s selfie collection right next to it. Its popularity in sales also shows the worth people have placed on selfie culture, and even hints at a vicarious nature of living through the selfies of others. 

## 3.4. Alpha Sphere

Figure 4. Screenshot of Alpha Sphere performance video (Hou 2003) 

The Alpha Sphere is an alternative form of musical controller. It is built for composition, production, performance, and learning. A series of pressure sensitive pads placed in a spherical form allows for an intuitive, unique, and interesting musical experience. Each pad can be programmed to trigger and array of different sounds, loops, or effects making it extremely versatile. 

A captivating use of haptic sensors and light driven feedback makes this piece worthwhile. It’s form and functionality creates an experience that demands attention. Many controllers, or interfaces, are prone to be attention deficit. They may even foster the split of our attention. Its spherical and tactile approaches create a welcoming engagement, offering excitement and encouraging focus.

## 3.5. Type-Hover-Swipe

Figure 5. Screenshot of type hover swipe in action (Taylor et. al 2014) 

Type-Hover-Swipe is a clever augmented keyboard. Making use of sensor technologies at can capture expressive motion gestures that can be used to control a device. Low-resolution infrared proximity sensors make the data capture simple. However, a large database of pre-mapped gestures allows for quick reverse lookup making its abilities quite robust. 

Using intuitive gestural motion to control devices seems, to me, a very natural progression in the development of technology. Adapting our natural ability to move in to ways that can control a device integrates a much more inclusive approach to design. It is much easier to wave than it is to type 100 words per minute.

## 3.6. Network Effect

Figure 6. Screenshot of Network Effect interface (Harris 2015) 

Network Effect is an interactive representation of data found across the Internet. Meant as a project to create a statement and pose question, this interactive landscape encapsulates you with media from all over the web offering questions of the nature of the media we post online, questions of the effects this media has on our behaviors online, and even questions of the way we see ourselves. 

This chaotic, almost psychotic, representation of our data really brings things to life. Instead of forcing us to think, manifest, and adopt what we believe the Internet to be, Network Effect simply uses the data itself to create an interpretation. Robust, fast, random, and disturbing as it is the perspective provided shines light on the “*information*” we are so inclined to gather.
