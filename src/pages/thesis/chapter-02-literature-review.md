## 2.1. Our Modern Digital Ballet

“*Youth instinctively understands the present environment–the electric drama. It lives mythically and in depth. This is the reason for the great alienation between generations. Wars, revolutions, civil uprisings are interfaces within the new environments created by electric informational media.*” (McLuhan 1967) 

Diving down the rabbit hole of digital communication research left me initially frustrated and disturbed. People are seemingly unaware and complacent when it comes to the effects our new technological environment is forcing on us. Many surveys show an overwhelmingly positive outlook towards *Online Social Networking* despite conversations about the Internet and how this new means of communication may be producing a 
“*nation of strangers*” (Turkle 1995) or reducing human-to-human commitment and enjoyment (Stoll 1995). 

“*I had to walk to school, in the snow, barefoot, uphill both ways.*” 

Each generation of mankind seems to think they had it harder than the next and often you can hear someone commenting on how much more “*connected*” we are today. It’s fairly easy and obvious to see that statement is true, at least on a variety of levels. However, it can be hard to see the effects this new age of connectivity really has on our lives physically, psychologically, and sociologically. The “*connectedness*” may actually disconnect us from ways of the past in order to keep moving on its preferred technological trajectory (Perez 2002). 

## 2.2. The Age Old Tale 

“*A world constructed from the familiar is the world in which there's nothing to learn.*”  (Pariser 2011)

Let’s take a look at an age-old tale. The tale of man makes monster–*technology*–and monster makes man. A question should be posed of whether or not this monster is good or bad and the answer is really a matter of perspective–*or possibly just in how you ask the question*. It’s no longer a question of good or bad, right or wrong. No, the means have been created and we must survey the results. 

We possess the ability to use technology in any way we please. Technology is a tool and the way it is used gives it meaning, morality, or purpose. The reality of the situation is that *technology just is*. 

*Man makes technology, technology has limitation, technological limitation defines possibility of usage and influences how we interact with it, interaction defines life experience, and life experience leads to more developed technology.* 

It’s not a question of if or will we create new technologies, it’s a question of how or what will we do with them? 

## 2.3. Bad Technology 

*Everything is changing–you, your family, your neighborhood, your education, your job, your government, your relation to “the others.”* (McLuhan 1967) 

Since technology itself is not inherently bad, and it’s not inherently good–*it just simply is*–the way we decide to interact with technology, the way we integrate it into our daily lives, now becomes what determines where it lies in the spectrum of human growth. 

*We* are what determine how useful a technology is in advancing our efforts. Whether that advancement is in a positive or negative direction. 

Over the years, the trajectory of technology and the trajectory of human development has mingled and pushed back on one another. We are caught in an infinite feedback loop of creation, which spawns usage, which fosters understanding, and in turn fuels the next iteration of creation. In other words, the technologies we create and live with affect the outcome of who we are and who we will be. This can be seen on many scales. 

Understanding–*or even just being aware*–that the technologies we create impact our life experience is crucial in reconciling bad with good. If we are aware of the ramifications a technology has on our interactions with each other, the way it changes how we function as a whole, we can then observe and adjust. 

## 2.4. Extension of Body 

“*The wheel is an extension of the foot. The book is an extension of the eye. Clothing is an 
extension of the skin. Electric circuitry, is an extension of the central nervous system.*” (McLuhan 1967) 

The digital revolution brought an era where technology was seen as a physical extension of body. An external source allowing us to learn, play, develop, and communicate in ways, speeds, and media unprecedented. Information could now be disseminated on grand scales with “*electric*” speed. However, it was viewed as a separate–*yet integral*–part of society. Perhaps due to its large, somewhat importable design–*clunky*. Or perhaps due to its inferior processing speeds where you could almost feel the response time. It was easy to make a distinction between human and technology. This no longer the case.

Imagine a world where lifelike avatars can have the contents of a human brain uploaded to them (Segal 2013) or where the decision to make artificial intelligence look less lifelike just so we can discern the two (CNBC 2016) yet still within the “*uncanny valley*” (Reichardt 1978). That time is near and with it comes the next evolution of our technological extension. An era where technology has now become extension of self. A deeper, more intimate, less escapable relationship between the things we make and the “what” we are. Where technology bridges the gap into an integrated relationship with our psychology and how we define, and perceive, ourselves. 

## 2.5. Extension of Self 

McLuhan focused on electric technology and how it effects or reshapes our lives. I will focus on the contemporary adaptation of this idea, *Online Social Networking* and how it effects or reshapes our lives. 

This can be seen as an extension of self; the extension of our self, our thoughts, our image, into the world through means of social media. It seems the progression of our relationship with technology has turned from being physical extensions to a much more psychological–*spiritual*–extension. 

## 2.6. You 

“*You*” are the everybody. The online collective, with the ability to choose to use Online Social Networks–*or not*. But let’s not forget, you are also the physical you. The you of reality. A human being, with a body, mortality, and daily interactions with the world you live in.

## 2.7. You the Cyborg 

The latest Science Fiction flick released on netflix about artificial intelligence, humanoid robots with emotions, laser gun initiated intergalactic wars; these are not the only truths when it comes to defining what it means to be a Cyborg. No, in fact, depending on how we frame the definition you–*yes, you*–are a Cyborg as well as every one of your peers. As coined by Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline in 1960 a “*Cyborg*,” or “*Cybernetic Organism,*” was traditionally defined as an advanced human being suited to live in extraterrestrial environments. In this case they were specifically referencing the advancement in space exploration of their time. However, if we look at this in broader scope with the hopes of applying it to our age, Clynes and Kline were simply speaking of humans who have enhanced their functioning with aid of technology. Therefore, leaving the human dependant on the technology for survival due to its integration in societal and animalistic evolution.

We have now reached a point of disconnect. A blur of self, which has turned into a marriage between the physical and digital worlds. A self now informed by who we *really are*, who we *think we are*, who we *think we would like to be*, who we *think we should be*, and who we *think society wants us to be*. All of this is made possible by an inseparable dance with digital technologies. A self that is curated by our own desires and encouraged by the online world.

*Your post now has 22 likes.*

## 2.8. You the Self 

It’s all about “*me me me*”. The relationship between human and technology is a seemingly selfish one. We create technologies to perform tasks; tasks in which we define and layout specific orders of operations–*also defined by our wants and desires*. This seems very similar to our relationship between perception of self and what we portray online. Now, if one of those technologies–*heaven forbid*–performs an “*unexpected*” or confusing function we are often upset, frustrated, even appalled by its defiance. How could *you*, a *technology*, do something so natural? 

We have reached a point where we inform our essence–*define our me*–through our online interactions. We are beginning to perceive ourselves in a new light. A light defined by a simple equation. 

*Life Experience + Online Social Network Interactions = Self* 

### Life Experience 

Life experience is what makes us human. It’s our ability to perceive and understand who we are and the world around us. All life experience is informed through time and the sum of the interactions we have had in the physical world up to this current point, right now. 

### Online Social Network Interactions 

Online Social Network Interactions manifest in a series of manners. There are direct interactions between users such as direct messaging or posting a bit of media on another user's wall. There are less direct interactions like providing feedback through some sort of “*liking*” or rating of another user’s post, posting media indirectly to a public media feed, sharing or reposting another user’s post on your own feed, or simply browsing a public feed of public users you may have no relations with. There is also the ability to curate–*even manicure*–your projected identity through a public profile consisting of meta data such as a list of past jobs, where you live, personal interests like a favorite band or most watched movie, or a featured image of anything you believe represents a desired  “*you*”. 

### Self 

The *awkward integration* of our life experience and online social network interactions. Awkward simply because we have yet to agree on written–even unwritten–rules that spell out guidelines of appropriate ways to integrate our online relationships with our relationships in the physical world. A lack of paint by numbers, or wise tales, that help us understand. Where is the book of etiquette on integrating the physical and online self? 

## 2.9. Those Who Control 

“*A squirrel dying in front of your house may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa.—Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder*” (Pariser 2011)

There are people who control how we view and interact with the information posted to Online Social Networks. Networks like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook only allow us to view the information in ways they have predefined. Namely, the way they have designed their online or application presence to function. Why is this bad? I see two main reasons:

### Reason One 

You are victim to the moral code and goals governed by those who create Online Social Networks. This includes social experiments such as manipulating emotional data to study psychological effects of users, whether it be positive or negative. For example, in 2014 Facebook manipulated 689,003 unknowing users by removing either all of the positive or all of the negative posts from their news feed to see how it effected their mood (Hill 2014). And the kicker is, these networks don’t need external consent because that consent is packed deep into the user agreements we must accept in order to become part of their network.

### Reason Two

We are addicted to their creations by deep desires to be accepted or FOMO–fear of missing out. Nearly three quarters of young adults were found to have had feelings of FOMO in relation to online social media. Not only does this add motivation behind our behavior but can lead to decay in psychological health and wellbeing as it may undermine self-reflection, distract from important life experiences, and even lead to physical danger during activities like driving (Przybylski 2013). Online addiction has been a conversation for some time and it only adds to the ramifications of what it means to be controlled by these means.

## 2.10. Those Who Can Control 

“*Knowledge is power.*” – Francis Bacon

If you knew what you were doing would you still do it? We have the power to control our decisions. A better informed you leads to better informed decisions. Better informed decisions–*in theory*–produce more favorable outcomes. Favorable in terms of reaching the goals you want. We will look at this all in perspective relative to personal wellbeing driving collective wellbeing. 

Are you aware of what posting, liking, or browsing your online social networking feed does to who you are, how you perceive yourself, and how you perceive the world around you? There are many sub cognitive functions and processes, high level systems, working to influence the way we form and believe who we are. If we knew a little more about how Online Social Networks reinforce these processes we could make better suited decisions when compiling the raw data for our own personal integration equation. A less awkward integration.

*Life Experience + Online Social Network Interactions = Self* 

## 2.11. The Selfie 

*A self-shot photo, usually taken with a mobile phone and posted online to social  media sites.* (Blumberg 2013)

The idea of a selfie is not new. Humans have been capturing their likeness for centuries. Self portraits have been captured in numerous forms of media from painting to photographic reproduction, however, advancement in technology now allows us to take self portraits–*selfies*–on an unprecedented rate and post them to a much larger audience–*the entire internet user base*–in the amount of time it may take you to ask your server what type of coffee they offer. 

“*After we go to the bathroom, can we go smoke a cigarette? I really need one. But first, let me take a selfie.*” (Chainsmokers 2014) 

The selfie trend is real and there are parallels between it, internet addiction, how we present ourselves online, and how we perceive who we are. Since the introduction of the iPhone 4 in 2010 the number of selfies posted online has exploded (Blumberg 2013). Paired with the ever growing ability to store enormous amounts of data in “*the cloud*” for little to no cost it’s so easy to post a selfie that we want to do it, we should do it, we must to do it. 

With these abilities comes the debate of impermanence versus permanence and what that means to our lives. It’s so easy to post a selfie that their value has decreased and we contribute less weight to their importance. However, they do have an impact and they are there forever–*internet purgatory*. As soon as something is posted online it is instantly replicated, mirrored, and on servers around the world. It is nearly impossible to ever remove this information leaving it, somewhat, irreversible. We are left with an addictive, easy to accomplish, potentially irreversible form of self expression that is helping mold the future of society. 

“*Can you guys help me pick a filter? I don't know if I should go with XX Pro or Valencia. I wanna look tan. What should my caption be? I want it to be clever. How about "Livin' with my bitches, hash tag LIVE". I only got 10 likes in the last 5 minutes. Do you think I should take it down? Let me take another selfie.*” (Chainsmokers 2014) 

One can argue that selfies are a new way of bonding, a harmless source of self-expression, or even just another way to connect with friends, but it’s important to think about the negative possibilities found in *selfie culture* too. Selfies are debated to have psychological issues in relation to Internet addiction and psychological health and well-being, and are also seen to have a significant correlation to narcissism (Sorokowski). To continue the discussion we should ask the question of whether or not narcissism is good or bad. In our case the dangers in narcissism are found rooted in its connections to egotism, self-esteem, and aggression. All of which can feed the cycle of Internet addiction, fear of missing out, and continue to alter perception of who we are or who we think we want to be.

## 2.12. The Message In A Bottle

“*Not all this new knowledge is factual or even explicit. Much knowledge, as the term is used here, is unspoken, consisting of assumptions piled atop assumptions, of fragmentary models, of unnoticed analogies, and it includes not simply logical and seemingly unemotional information data, but values, the products of passion and emotion, not to mention imagination and intuition.*” (Toffler 1991)

"*The medium is the message*" is a phrase coined by McLuhan. This phrase claims the form of a medium embeds itself in the message. In other words the medium influences how the message is received.

Let’s take a look at this in relation to an antiquated form of communication, *the message in a bottle*. It’s easy to think the bottle is an empty container and has no meaning. I don’t believe that. The medium itself actually changes how we communicate. With the bottle comes the imagination of the bottle’s story. We know someone took the time to write a message simply to throw it into the ocean with hopes it would reach another party. The implications of this leave wonder in the why adding context when the message is received and read. The same message simply handed to another party would not be accepted and perceived in the same manner. 

Let’s connect this idea directly to the selfie. Traditionally, a photograph was taken and could be passed around as a physical object. Today, they are placed online for all to see, basically untouched, in a non-physical digital state. What would happen if we took that bottle–*online social networks hosting selfies*–and shattered it looking for new ways to reconstruct it?
