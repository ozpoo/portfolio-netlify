## 5.1. Personal Challenge 

I have long made it a personal challenge to find ways I can create functional, worthy, design solutions by means of processes or ideas I have yet to explore. I believe we should hold ourselves accountable to a standard that always fosters growth. The world around us is constantly in flux, as we should be. In order for you to gain a better understanding of my process, and methods of decision-making, I will now define what design is to me. 

### Defining design 

Defining design is a lot like defining life. We are surrounded by objects and systems in which we have no choice but to interact with. These interactions provide the stimulus we use to form unique perceptions of reality. In turn creating what we call life experience. It is this gained life experience that fills us with inspiration. 

We are all simply self-altered reflections of our life experience. The only knowledge I have is the knowledge I’ve gained. The only way I gain this knowledge is through life experience. Being aware of this gives me drive to always grow, adapt, and build upon the past. 

What was should not, and what will may not. 

Through question I find new ways. It’s not the problem at hand, it’s the opportunities outside that intrigue me. If someone says “Design me a website” I will start by questioning. “What is a website?” As time moves on and society changes so does our knowledge, and that in turn changes the definition of the world around us. If the world is constantly changing so should the way we approach and solve problems.

As a catalyst of change I tell myself “If you aren’t pissing anyone off, you aren’t doing it right.” As an advocate for growth I tell myself “If you don’t feel unsure, you aren’t growing”. Design is created and endured by all, but the process and inspiration lies within the individual. And ultimately, it is all just a reflection of life. So, defining design is a lot like defining life. 

Design is an approach to solve a problem through a process within. The definition of design should change with world and we should find inspiration inside in the problems we face. 

## 5.2. Works

Below is a collection of works performed during this creative response. Through experimentation, I gained a better understanding of technological limitations as well as obtaining observational perspective over the data I began to mold. All responses were informed by my three guiding questions: 

### Guiding question one 

*In what ways are people engaging with Online Social Networks to develop a deeper sense of self?*

### Guiding question two 

*Do alternative methods of viewing media posted to Online Social networks offer a different perspective of their message?* 

### Guiding question three 

*Do alternative methods of interacting with media posted to Online Social networks offer a different perspective of their message?*

### Selfie Grid 

*An interface exploration exploring alternative and algorithmically generated grid structures to present selfie data.*

![Figure 22. Screenshot of selfie grid on page load](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_050_image_0001.jpg "Figure 22. Screenshot of selfie grid on page load")

Why is it, when viewing a feed of posts, they are often presented equal in terms of size, space, type treatment, or color? This exploration dealt with just that. By changing size and using a more complex grid structure a new hierarchy was able to unfold. Change in size and placement offer alternative perspective, selfies that may have otherwise been looked over gained dominance allowing the selfie story to change. The grid is generated algorithmically by using the meta-data of the selfie. For example, how many likes may control its size and data and time of when it was posted may control its location on the grid.

### Kinect gestural interfacing

*A gestural interfacing exploration looking at how humans can interact with digital information through natural interactions using a Microsoft Kinect.* 

![Figure 23. Screenshot of user being tracked with Microsof Kinect while interacting with a digital object](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_051_image_0001.jpg "Figure 23. Screenshot of user being tracked with Microsof Kinect while interacting with a digital object")

Tackling the wonders of real-time image and depth processing, this exploration looked at alternative gestural ways to interact with the digital world–*including a humans body and their movements*. A psychological phenomenon occurred as the user claimed to feel the object as she used physical movements off screen to control the ball on screen offering a new perspective of this otherwise intangible object. This proves a promising way to allow interaction to inform our perspective of the media we interact with.

### Selfie Quilt Generator 

*First database aggregation study using PHP and publicly accessible Instagram data to gather and compile selfies into a programmatically generated quilt.*

![Figure 24. Screenshot of selfies captured by selfie quilt generator](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_052_image_0001.jpg "Figure 24. Screenshot of selfies captured by selfie quilt generator")

There are quite an array of colors, textures, and ideas you will view when browsing through selfies. Selfie Culture has become a collective attempt at digital quilt making. The communal aspect of quilt making speaks on our use of Online Social Networks to build sense of self. By capturing selfies I was able to programmatically generate selfie quilts. These quilts were compiled by selfies, chosen at random, and placed together on a quilt-like grid. The results were diverse, energetic, and colorful patterns.

![Figure 25. A programmatically generated selfie quilt](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_053_image_0001.jpg "Figure 25. A programmatically generated selfie quilt")

### Selfieverse 

*An interface experiment projecting selfies into 3 dimensional space for alternative means of exploration.*

![Figure 26. Screenshot of interface while navigating through a three dimensional selfieverse](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_054_image_0001.jpg "Figure 26. Screenshot of interface while navigating through a three dimensional selfieverse")

A photograph is two-dimensional. Must it always be presented that way? What if it was extruded onto some other form? By projecting selfies on three dimensional boxes and placing them throughout a three dimensional space, this exploration allows users to interact with selfies in a digital landscape closer to the way we interact with the physical world–*unlike traditional two dimensional website feeds*. The ability to “fly” through the selfies, gave different levels of hierarchy dependent on where you were during your path of travel. This form of interaction we the first time I started to notice trends in the data like nude selfies and mass use of advertisement. 

### Sounds of twitter

The sonification of data found on Twitter as means of exploring alternative ways to “visualize” data.

![Figure 27. Screenshot of twitter during realtime sonification](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_055_image_0001.jpg "Figure 27. Screenshot of twitter during realtime sonification")

The information age is upon us. Thousands, upon millions of bytes of data are being stored in servers all over the world. What other ways can we view this data to help us gain a better understanding of what’s going on? By pulling popular tweets from twitter's public API I used their included text to create scores, in real time, for creating synthesized sound. Sonifying data presents a different way to interpret and understand data–perception; through it patterns began to emerge. A system of different tones linking to characters and words created repetition and the ability to learn and understand through abstract, synthesized sounds.

### Lithography 

*Experimentation with alternative means of polyester plates and the visual language of collages made by selfies made tangible.*

![Figure 28. Photograph of initial print studies](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_056_image_0001.jpg "Figure 28. Photograph of initial print studies")

Selfies are traditionally viewed in their original, un-manipulated, intangible, digital form. A photograph, traditionally, is physical. We can take them, pass them around, bend them, rip them, and give them a physically impacted history. In order to bring selfies back out to the physical world I incorporated the traditional print process of lithography. Through this exploration I touched on aspects of collage, emphasizing detail, and haptic feedback to create a new perspective. These prints created a much more intimate, detail oriented view of selfies as opposed to a digital feed viewed on a device.

### Hai

*An interactive exploration of human-to-computer awareness through typical human-to-human interactions.*

![Figure 29. Screenshot of HAI study after wave gesture has been recognized](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_057_image_0001.jpg "Figure 29. Screenshot of HAI study after wave gesture has been recognized")

Our devices–*most often*–are programmed to be unaware of us, as humans, in terms of normal human-to-human interaction. They are not prompted to respond to us in more natural ways, though they have the ability to see and understand a gamut of our human-likeness. Are we aware of these abilities? Does the inability for us to interact with our devices in more intimate ways leave us more or less in the dark about just how aware these objects actually are? If we become more aware of their awareness would it change the way we see our relationship with these devices? 

In the program's default state the screen displays the back of a human's head as if  they are looking away. When someone approaches the computer, by using webcam gesture recognition technology, if the active party waves a sequence will initiate. The image then, as if responding to the gesture and turning around, changes to a face looking directly at you. A computer-generated voice then speaks out loud a randomly chosen greeting. After a designated pause the program goes back to an initial state where you can only see the back of a figure’s head. From this point you may repeat waving and beckoning the program to greet you with different phrases. 

### Glitch 

*A proposed web application offering alternative ways to view, filter, and understand what is happening with your Online Social Network accounts.*

![Figure 30. Screenshot of Glitch interface showing alternative gridded layout and filtering ability](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_058_image_0001.jpg "Figure 30. Screenshot of Glitch interface showing alternative gridded layout and filtering ability")

There are not many options–*variations*–in the ways we can view our Online Social Networks. These networks capture loads of data about our usage; yet, they don’t allow us to better understand our habits and patterns of usage. People often complain and are effected by how certain types of posts come up in their feed and they find it annoying, things that are negative or maybe even an advertisement. An Online Social Network functions much differently than a social network–*something that has been around since humans lived together*. Why is this? Should this be the case? Glitch is focused strongly on achieving alternative perspective through viewing and interacting with the media in Online Social Networks. 

Glitch explores ways to allow the user alternative modes of viewing their posts and includes a variety of non-traditional Online Social Networking tools. It offers the ability to view visual graphics of usage. When, where, and what are you posting? See patterns of your posts in terms of when you are posting the most, or least, most positive, or most negative. Remember that “friend” you never talk to but still shows up on your feed? That’s not how things work in the physical world. Your social network, and how often you interact with people, is dictated by your interactions. On Glitch, as you cease to interact with individuals they will fade back in importance being set to an inactive friends list. Also, to feel less controlled by notifications activate a proximity interaction sensor. If you are too close to your friend communication will be turned off on Glitch allowing–*or even forcing*–you to interact face to face.

## 5.4. Interactive Selfie Cube

![Figure 31. Interactive Selfie Cube sitting on its proximity-sensing base](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_060_image_0001.jpg "Figure 31. Interactive Selfie Cube sitting on its proximity-sensing base")

My final creative response is a reflection of all the ideas and explorations discussed before in this paper. The purpose of this response was to create a new experience, an alternative way to view and interact with the selfies we are posting. Through this alternative mode of viewing and interacting, I hope to engage users in a way that leads them to a new perspective. A perspective offering heightened ability to understand, question, and reflect on the media that is being posted. A perspective that wasn’t apparent before. Ultimately, this response is to help develop a greater sense of awareness. Helping us become more aware that our online self is synonymous to our physical self–extension of self–and with that comes consequences. Consequences that may have dire effects on our psychological and physical well-being. Consequences that, by our choice, can be avoided by the way we interact online.

### Guiding question two 

*Do alternative methods of viewing media posted to Online Social networks offer a different perspective of their message?* 

The Interactive Selfie Cube controls an interface. That interface is populated with the selfie data I collected and observed as was discussed earlier. By taking influence from previous creative responses, this interface offers an alternative method of viewing selfies. The ways they are presented is drastically different than a standard mode of viewing on social networks such as Instagram or Facebook allowing anyone who engages to be part of the experience and gain new perspective. 

### Guiding question three 

*Do alternative methods of interacting with media posted to Online Social networks offer a different perspective of their message?* 

The Interactive Selfie Cube offers a non-traditional multisensory approach at interfacing with digital media. The alternative mode of interaction is drastically different then the standard modes adopted by popular viewing devices such as a laptop or a mobile touch screen device. This allows anyone who engages with the cube to interact in novel ways and gain new perspective. 

### The Design 

The Interactive Selfie Cube is designed to be a forcibly noticeable interactive experience, a multisensory invasion of what people are defining as self. By designing an interactive device that engages auditory, haptic, kinesthetic, and visual feedback we can create more memorable and understandable experiences (Shams, Ladan, and Seitz 2008). 

I do not know how or what people will perceive through their interactions. Nor do  I know what questions they will pose to themselves. There are, however, some questions I aim to illicit within the experience while also making the engaged more aware of their interactions with devices and that devices are aware of them: 

*Should I continue to interact with this media? Am I comfortable with how I am viewing this media? Am I comfortable with how the media is portrayed? Do I portray myself that way? Do people perceive me the way I perceive this media?* 

![Figure 32. First physical cube mockups that were created upon conception](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_062_image_0001.jpg "Figure 32. First physical cube mockups that were created upon conception")

The controller is in the form of a cube. I chose this form for a few reasons. In an earlier response called Selfieverse I projected the form of a square, which is the traditional selfie format, into three dimensions, which creates a cube. The are many forms a controller could have, but I wanted one that was pure to geometry, simple to create, simple to understand, and easy to hold. Through studies of size I found the ridges of a cube prove easy to grasp. Also, as a fairly intuitive object to hold, pickup, rotate in your grasp to observe, and set down, it seemed like a great fit for the project.

![Figure 33. A series of size and material studies](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_063_image_0001.jpg "Figure 33. A series of size and material studies")

The materials used needed to accomplish a few goals. I wanted the controller to represent the integration of technology and nature and be a statement of the human ability to create. Through this, I hope to provide an instant reminder to the engaged of the different worlds we live in, including the differences, and similarities, of technology and nature. The cube is made of raw industrial materials. Hanger tape for plumbing, nuts and bolts, and laser cut white acrylic. These raw industrial materials not only allow for cheap exploration during development but also provide much function to the form. Hardware can be structural, functional, and aesthetic and I used this to my advantage.

![Figure 34. Detail shot of materials used in construction](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_064_image_0001.jpg "Figure 34. Detail shot of materials used in construction")

Acrylic came to be a necessity in terms of material. In order to make this cube come to life I wanted to incorporate lights from the inside. To accomplish this, I needed a material that would be strong, yet malleable, and allow diffused light through. While acrylic straight off the shelf did not provide the proper visual appeal, with studies, I found adding a slight frost with sandpaper created a great look a light diffusion. 

During the material studies I also began formal studies to figure out a structurally stable joint in order to piece the cube together. I did not want to glue the plastic together because I wanted the design to be modular, adaptable, and easy to debug. With this, I found a simple puzzle style notch system helped keep the panels precisely in place without sliding and with the right pattern tension. It also, under tension, would force the material into a perfectly fitted cube.
