## 5.1. Personal Challenge

I have long made it a personal challenge to find ways I can create functional, worthy, design solutions by means of processes or ideas I have yet to explore. I believe we should hold ourselves accountable to a standard that always fosters growth. The world around us is constantly in flux, as we should be. In order for you to gain a better understanding of my process, and methods of decision-making, I will now define what design is to me. 

### Defining design

Defining design is a lot like defining life. We are surrounded by objects and systems in which we have no choice but to interact with. These interactions provide the stimulus we use to form unique perceptions of reality. In turn creating what we call life experience. It is this gained life experience that fills us with inspiration. 

We are all simply self-altered reflections of our life experience. The only knowledge I have is the knowledge I’ve gained. The only way I gain this knowledge is through life experience. Being aware of this gives me drive to always grow, adapt, and build upon the past. 

What was should not, and what will may not. 

Through question I find new ways. It’s not the problem at hand, it’s the opportunities outside that intrigue me. If someone says “Design me a website” I will start by questioning. “What is a website?” As time moves on and society changes so does our knowledge, and that in turn changes the definition of the world around us. If the world is constantly changing so should the way we approach and solve problems.

As a catalyst of change I tell myself “If you aren’t pissing anyone off, you aren’t doing it right.” As an advocate for growth I tell myself “If you don’t feel unsure, you aren’t growing”. Design is created and endured by all, but the process and inspiration lies within the individual. And ultimately, it is all just a reflection of life. So, defining design is a lot like defining life. 

Design is an approach to solve a problem through a process within. The definition of design should change with world and we should find inspiration inside in the problems we face. 

## 5.2. Works

Below is a collection of works performed during this creative response. Through experimentation, I gained a better understanding of technological limitations as well as obtaining observational perspective over the data I began to mold. All responses were informed by my three guiding questions: 

### Guiding question one

*In what ways are people engaging with Online Social Networks to develop a deeper sense of self?*

### Guiding question two

*Do alternative methods of viewing media posted to Online Social networks offer a different perspective of their message?* 

### Guiding question three

*Do alternative methods of interacting with media posted to Online Social networks offer a different perspective of their message?*

### Selfie Grid

*An interface exploration exploring alternative and algorithmically generated grid structures to present selfie data.*

![Figure 22. Screenshot of selfie grid on page load](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_050_image_0001.jpg "Figure 22. Screenshot of selfie grid on page load")

Why is it, when viewing a feed of posts, they are often presented equal in terms of size, space, type treatment, or color? This exploration dealt with just that. By changing size and using a more complex grid structure a new hierarchy was able to unfold. Change in size and placement offer alternative perspective, selfies that may have otherwise been looked over gained dominance allowing the selfie story to change. The grid is generated algorithmically by using the meta-data of the selfie. For example, how many likes may control its size and data and time of when it was posted may control its location on the grid.

### Kinect gestural interfacing

*A gestural interfacing exploration looking at how humans can interact with digital information through natural interactions using a Microsoft Kinect.* 

![Figure 23. Screenshot of user being tracked with Microsof Kinect while interacting with a digital object](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_051_image_0001.jpg "Figure 23. Screenshot of user being tracked with Microsof Kinect while interacting with a digital object")

Tackling the wonders of real-time image and depth processing, this exploration looked at alternative gestural ways to interact with the digital world–*including a humans body and their movements*. A psychological phenomenon occurred as the user claimed to feel the object as she used physical movements off screen to control the ball on screen offering a new perspective of this otherwise intangible object. This proves a promising way to allow interaction to inform our perspective of the media we interact with.

### Selfie Quilt Generator

*First database aggregation study using PHP and publicly accessible Instagram data to gather and compile selfies into a programmatically generated quilt.*

![Figure 24. Screenshot of selfies captured by selfie quilt generator](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_052_image_0001.jpg "Figure 24. Screenshot of selfies captured by selfie quilt generator")

There are quite an array of colors, textures, and ideas you will view when browsing through selfies. Selfie Culture has become a collective attempt at digital quilt making. The communal aspect of quilt making speaks on our use of Online Social Networks to build sense of self. By capturing selfies I was able to programmatically generate selfie quilts. These quilts were compiled by selfies, chosen at random, and placed together on a quilt-like grid. The results were diverse, energetic, and colorful patterns.

![Figure 25. A programmatically generated selfie quilt](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_053_image_0001.jpg "Figure 25. A programmatically generated selfie quilt")

### Selfieverse

*An interface experiment projecting selfies into 3 dimensional space for alternative means of exploration.*

![Figure 26. Screenshot of interface while navigating through a three dimensional selfieverse](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_054_image_0001.jpg "Figure 26. Screenshot of interface while navigating through a three dimensional selfieverse")

A photograph is two-dimensional. Must it always be presented that way? What if it was extruded onto some other form? By projecting selfies on three dimensional boxes and placing them throughout a three dimensional space, this exploration allows users to interact with selfies in a digital landscape closer to the way we interact with the physical world–*unlike traditional two dimensional website feeds*. The ability to “fly” through the selfies, gave different levels of hierarchy dependent on where you were during your path of travel. This form of interaction we the first time I started to notice trends in the data like nude selfies and mass use of advertisement. 

### Sounds of twitter

The sonification of data found on Twitter as means of exploring alternative ways to “visualize” data.

![Figure 27. Screenshot of twitter during realtime sonification](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_055_image_0001.jpg "Figure 27. Screenshot of twitter during realtime sonification")

The information age is upon us. Thousands, upon millions of bytes of data are being stored in servers all over the world. What other ways can we view this data to help us gain a better understanding of what’s going on? By pulling popular tweets from twitter's public API I used their included text to create scores, in real time, for creating synthesized sound. Sonifying data presents a different way to interpret and understand data–perception; through it patterns began to emerge. A system of different tones linking to characters and words created repetition and the ability to learn and understand through abstract, synthesized sounds.

### Lithography

*Experimentation with alternative means of polyester plates and the visual language of collages made by selfies made tangible.*

![Figure 28. Photograph of initial print studies](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_056_image_0001.jpg "Figure 28. Photograph of initial print studies")

Selfies are traditionally viewed in their original, un-manipulated, intangible, digital form. A photograph, traditionally, is physical. We can take them, pass them around, bend them, rip them, and give them a physically impacted history. In order to bring selfies back out to the physical world I incorporated the traditional print process of lithography. Through this exploration I touched on aspects of collage, emphasizing detail, and haptic feedback to create a new perspective. These prints created a much more intimate, detail oriented view of selfies as opposed to a digital feed viewed on a device.

### Hai

*An interactive exploration of human-to-computer awareness through typical human-to-human interactions.*

![Figure 29. Screenshot of HAI study after wave gesture has been recognized](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_057_image_0001.jpg "Figure 29. Screenshot of HAI study after wave gesture has been recognized")

Our devices–*most often*–are programmed to be unaware of us, as humans, in terms of normal human-to-human interaction. They are not prompted to respond to us in more natural ways, though they have the ability to see and understand a gamut of our human-likeness. Are we aware of these abilities? Does the inability for us to interact with our devices in more intimate ways leave us more or less in the dark about just how aware these objects actually are? If we become more aware of their awareness would it change the way we see our relationship with these devices? 

In the program's default state the screen displays the back of a human's head as if  they are looking away. When someone approaches the computer, by using webcam gesture recognition technology, if the active party waves a sequence will initiate. The image then, as if responding to the gesture and turning around, changes to a face looking directly at you. A computer-generated voice then speaks out loud a randomly chosen greeting. After a designated pause the program goes back to an initial state where you can only see the back of a figure’s head. From this point you may repeat waving and beckoning the program to greet you with different phrases. 

### Glitch

*A proposed web application offering alternative ways to view, filter, and understand what is happening with your Online Social Network accounts.*

![Figure 30. Screenshot of Glitch interface showing alternative gridded layout and filtering ability](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_058_image_0001.jpg "Figure 30. Screenshot of Glitch interface showing alternative gridded layout and filtering ability")

There are not many options–*variations*–in the ways we can view our Online Social Networks. These networks capture loads of data about our usage; yet, they don’t allow us to better understand our habits and patterns of usage. People often complain and are effected by how certain types of posts come up in their feed and they find it annoying, things that are negative or maybe even an advertisement. An Online Social Network functions much differently than a social network–*something that has been around since humans lived together*. Why is this? Should this be the case? Glitch is focused strongly on achieving alternative perspective through viewing and interacting with the media in Online Social Networks. 

Glitch explores ways to allow the user alternative modes of viewing their posts and includes a variety of non-traditional Online Social Networking tools. It offers the ability to view visual graphics of usage. When, where, and what are you posting? See patterns of your posts in terms of when you are posting the most, or least, most positive, or most negative. Remember that “friend” you never talk to but still shows up on your feed? That’s not how things work in the physical world. Your social network, and how often you interact with people, is dictated by your interactions. On Glitch, as you cease to interact with individuals they will fade back in importance being set to an inactive friends list. Also, to feel less controlled by notifications activate a proximity interaction sensor. If you are too close to your friend communication will be turned off on Glitch allowing–*or even forcing*–you to interact face to face.

## 5.4. Interactive Selfie Cube

![Figure 31. Interactive Selfie Cube sitting on its proximity-sensing base](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_060_image_0001.jpg "Figure 31. Interactive Selfie Cube sitting on its proximity-sensing base")

My final creative response is a reflection of all the ideas and explorations discussed before in this paper. The purpose of this response was to create a new experience, an alternative way to view and interact with the selfies we are posting. Through this alternative mode of viewing and interacting, I hope to engage users in a way that leads them to a new perspective. A perspective offering heightened ability to understand, question, and reflect on the media that is being posted. A perspective that wasn’t apparent before. Ultimately, this response is to help develop a greater sense of awareness. Helping us become more aware that our online self is synonymous to our physical self–extension of self–and with that comes consequences. Consequences that may have dire effects on our psychological and physical well-being. Consequences that, by our choice, can be avoided by the way we interact online.

### Guiding question two

*Do alternative methods of viewing media posted to Online Social networks offer a different perspective of their message?* 

The Interactive Selfie Cube controls an interface. That interface is populated with the selfie data I collected and observed as was discussed earlier. By taking influence from previous creative responses, this interface offers an alternative method of viewing selfies. The ways they are presented is drastically different than a standard mode of viewing on social networks such as Instagram or Facebook allowing anyone who engages to be part of the experience and gain new perspective. 

### Guiding question three

*Do alternative methods of interacting with media posted to Online Social networks offer a different perspective of their message?* 

The Interactive Selfie Cube offers a non-traditional multisensory approach at interfacing with digital media. The alternative mode of interaction is drastically different then the standard modes adopted by popular viewing devices such as a laptop or a mobile touch screen device. This allows anyone who engages with the cube to interact in novel ways and gain new perspective. 

### The Design

The Interactive Selfie Cube is designed to be a forcibly noticeable interactive experience, a multisensory invasion of what people are defining as self. By designing an interactive device that engages auditory, haptic, kinesthetic, and visual feedback we can create more memorable and understandable experiences (Shams, Ladan, and Seitz 2008). 

I do not know how or what people will perceive through their interactions. Nor do  I know what questions they will pose to themselves. There are, however, some questions I aim to illicit within the experience while also making the engaged more aware of their interactions with devices and that devices are aware of them: 

*Should I continue to interact with this media? Am I comfortable with how I am viewing this media? Am I comfortable with how the media is portrayed? Do I portray myself that way? Do people perceive me the way I perceive this media?* 

![Figure 32. First physical cube mockups that were created upon conception](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_062_image_0001.jpg "Figure 32. First physical cube mockups that were created upon conception")

The controller is in the form of a cube. I chose this form for a few reasons. In an earlier response called Selfieverse I projected the form of a square, which is the traditional selfie format, into three dimensions, which creates a cube. The are many forms a controller could have, but I wanted one that was pure to geometry, simple to create, simple to understand, and easy to hold. Through studies of size I found the ridges of a cube prove easy to grasp. Also, as a fairly intuitive object to hold, pickup, rotate in your grasp to observe, and set down, it seemed like a great fit for the project.

![Figure 33. A series of size and material studies](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_063_image_0001.jpg "Figure 33. A series of size and material studies")

The materials used needed to accomplish a few goals. I wanted the controller to represent the integration of technology and nature and be a statement of the human ability to create. Through this, I hope to provide an instant reminder to the engaged of the different worlds we live in, including the differences, and similarities, of technology and nature. The cube is made of raw industrial materials. Hanger tape for plumbing, nuts and bolts, and laser cut white acrylic. These raw industrial materials not only allow for cheap exploration during development but also provide much function to the form. Hardware can be structural, functional, and aesthetic and I used this to my advantage.

![Figure 34. Detail shot of materials used in construction](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_064_image_0001.jpg "Figure 34. Detail shot of materials used in construction")

Acrylic came to be a necessity in terms of material. In order to make this cube come to life I wanted to incorporate lights from the inside. To accomplish this, I needed a material that would be strong, yet malleable, and allow diffused light through. While acrylic straight off the shelf did not provide the proper visual appeal, with studies, I found adding a slight frost with sandpaper created a great look a light diffusion. 

During the material studies I also began formal studies to figure out a structurally stable joint in order to piece the cube together. I did not want to glue the plastic together because I wanted the design to be modular, adaptable, and easy to debug. With this, I found a simple puzzle style notch system helped keep the panels precisely in place without sliding and with the right pattern tension. It also, under tension, would force the material into a perfectly fitted cube.

![Figure 35. Material treatment and form studies ](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_065_image_0001.jpg "Figure 35. Material treatment and form studies ")

![Figure 36. Inner frame study](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_065_image_0002.jpg "Figure 36. Inner frame study")

The electronics within the cube consist of a few major boards and chips. The main brain is an Arduino UNO. This controls the sensors, data transmission, and light patters. An accelerometer captures the cubes orientation on the x, y, and z access. These numbers are how all interactivity is interpreted in the cube and in the visualization. The numbers are transmitted, in real time, from the cube to another Arduino UNO. The receiver is then connected to a computer to share and control visualization.

![Figure 37. Forming a central platform for inner cube electronics](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_066_image_0001.jpg "Figure 37. Forming a central platform for inner cube electronics")

In order to create a seamless illusion of integration between object and media I needed to incorporate integrated wireless electronics. Namely, these are sensors that can receive and transmit data from the cube to another computer. For this to work the cube needed its own power source. 

![Figure 38. Set of materials ordered before beginning development ](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_067_image_0001.jpg "Figure 38. Set of materials ordered before beginning development ")

![Figure 39. First functioning solar arduino project ](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_067_image_0002.jpg "Figure 39. First functioning solar arduino project ")

I took this opportunity to explore renewable energy. By means of lithium ion batteries and solar cells I was able to create a charging system that uses the suns light. Future goals in my work incorporate creating self-sustainable electronics and this fit well within that research, as it is also important for us to think about sustainability in all design.

![Figure 40. Solar charger detail shot](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_068_image_0001.jpg "Figure 40. Solar charger detail shot")

Attention to detail is key when creating function and beautiful solutions. Now I knew I needed a power source to be mounted inside the cube. Meaning, there would need to be something to charge this power source. It would be very inconvenient and messy to have to pull off a panel each time I needed to charge the unit, so I searched for a more integrated solution. I was able to make use of a microphone XLR plug. They consist of four wires, in this case I only needed two, and provide for a pleasing and finished look.

![Figure 41. Detail of charging port](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_069_image_0001.jpg "Figure 41. Detail of charging port")

![Figure 42. Detail of charging port with cable ](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_069_image_0002.jpg "Figure 42. Detail of charging port with cable ")

![Figure 43. Connecting and testing external power charging port ](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_070_image_0001.jpg "Figure 43. Connecting and testing external power charging port ")

![Figure 44. Finished cube connected and charging with solar panel ](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_070_image_0002.jpg "Figure 44. Finished cube connected and charging with solar panel ")

I set out for this to be a wireless project. The ability to be mobile–*free of wires*–with an object gives a completely different experience than one that is attached. It is much closer to the physical world to be able to walk around with something while it still gives feedback to a system. For this reason I needed to find the proper technology for wireless data transfer. After some research I found a cost effective set of RF transmitter and receiver pairs. I ordered five of them, which was a good thing. They were cheap the circuitry seemed to be flawed in some of them. After soldering on external antennas and using the cubes frame as a transmitter I was able to create a more than sufficient data transfer.

![Figure 45. Wireless RF transmitters and receivers used in cube](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_071_image_0001.jpg "Figure 45. Wireless RF transmitters and receivers used in cube")

I have found the incorporation of lights really brings things to life. With light, you can replicate so much of the human spectrum. Light can show mood, urgency, it can be warm, cold, it can be inviting, or it can startle. In order to make my Interactive Selfie Cube come alive lights would be a necessity. They would allow the ability to incorporate personality, feedback, and emotion. In order to do this I needed to figure out a functional, effective solution to applying lights inside of the cube.

![Figure 46. LED lights connected and being tested with battery power and wireless data transfer](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_072_image_0001.jpg "Figure 46. LED lights connected and being tested with battery power and wireless data transfer")

I found a great strip of super bright programmable RGB LEDs in a strip meaning, I program any of the lights, at any given time, whether to be on or off and what color I want it to be allowing me to add pulsing tweens, patterns, and a variety of color to the cube interactions. This is all great; accept a linear strip would not work well it terms of mounting them inside my cube.

![Figure 47. Deconstruction of LED strip in order to solder custom string for cage ](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_073_image_0001.jpg "Figure 47. Deconstruction of LED strip in order to solder custom string for cage ")

![Figure 48. Detail of soldered connections for custom LED strand ](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_073_image_0002.jpg "Figure 48. Detail of soldered connections for custom LED strand ")

Too create an otherwise seamless incorporation of the LEDs into the cube I made use of the ability to cut them apart and solder them together in any order and with any length I would need. This was great, however, I included 24 lights. Each light required 6 soldered connections tightly packed together. This called for a grand total of 144 tedious solders just to incorporate the lights.

![Figure 49. Experimenting with installed LED string and interactions ](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_074_image_0001.jpg "Figure 49. Experimenting with installed LED string and interactions ")

After the brains and lights were installed it was time to start testing and adapting the gesture sensitive functionalities paired with light change. As I said there is an accelerometer that can gauge x, y, and z acceleration and also the ability to sense 6 orientations. Meaning, as you flip the cube from side to side it knows what side it has landed on.

![Figure 50. Setting up LCD display for wireless data capture and debugging ](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_075_image_0001.jpg "Figure 50. Setting up LCD display for wireless data capture and debugging ")

![Figure 51. Consolidating and cleaning up breadboard layout ](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_075_image_0002.jpg "Figure 51. Consolidating and cleaning up breadboard layout ")

![Figure 52. Testing accelerometer and wireless data transfer](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_076_image_0001.jpg "Figure 52. Testing accelerometer and wireless data transfer")

After much testing of the data transfer through an RF wireless connection while running light functions I began to run into limitations of the Arduino processor and my power source. In order to capture real time acceleration data on the x, y, and z access I needed to be sending the output to the computer as much as possible. While doing this and running the light animation the Arduino would begin to be overloaded with processing and noticeable hesitation was seen. In order to adjust for this limitation I decided to only listen for orientation changes. Meaning, I could transmit much less frequently freeing up more processing power for the lights. 

The other limitation I ran into was the amount of power the LEDs required and a non-consistent voltage pattern interference provided from the battery. If I ran all LEDs at full power the lights would not display their true color. For instance, bright white became very warm. To adjust for this I run all LEDs at most 50% of optimal brightness to save on energy. This provided to be plenty bright enough in a dim lit room. The inconsistent voltage pattern interference caused a flickering of the lights. To adjust for this I decided to add a jitter of life to the lights. Each light was given a certain threshold of brightness. Every pass of the program the lights are assigned to increase or decrease their brightness by a randomly generated number within the threshold. This causes the illusion that every light is getting slightly larger or smaller as if the cube is jittering with life.

![Figure 53. Adding foam to help deaden sound and soften touch](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_077_image_0001.jpg "Figure 53. Adding foam to help deaden sound and soften touch")

 After being able to play with the cube for a while during testing I needed to start refining the experience. The acrylic, at larger size, was a little more malleable and didn’t feel as soft and the cavity of the cube had a plastic sounding echo. I needed to deaden the echo and make the cube feel more solid. To accomplish this I added a foam buffer between the plates and the cage.

![Figure 54. Detail shot of inner electronics](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_078_image_0001.jpg "Figure 54. Detail shot of inner electronics")

The final details were cleaning up the circuitry and figuring out a way to power the cube on and off. There are a wide variety of power switches. Toggle switches, switches with lights, button switches, large switches, small switches, but I needed my switch to make sense. While opening an apartment garage I saw a keyhole and remembered that there are key driven electric power switches. I instantly ran home, researched, and found a distributor that supplied them. 

I enjoyed the idea of a key power switch because it touches on some of the questions I was attempting to illicit during this interaction. The social ideas behind keys are ideas of importance, or possibly hiding, storing, or keeping something safe. Should you interact with this cube? What will happen when you turn the key? Turning a key is also a much more interactive approach at a switch as well as it forces hand eye coordination and takes a little bit longer than just pushing a button.

Meaning, as you flip the cube from side to side it knows what side it has landed on.

![Figure 52. Testing accelerometer and wireless data transfer](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_076_image_0001.jpg "Figure 52. Testing accelerometer and wireless data transfer")

After much testing of the data transfer through an RF wireless connection while running light functions I began to run into limitations of the Arduino processor and my power source. In order to capture real time acceleration data on the x, y, and z access I needed to be sending the output to the computer as much as possible. While doing this and running the light animation the Arduino would begin to be overloaded with processing and noticeable hesitation was seen. In order to adjust for this limitation I decided to only listen for orientation changes. Meaning, I could transmit much less frequently freeing up more processing power for the lights. 

The other limitation I ran into was the amount of power the LEDs required and a non-consistent voltage pattern interference provided from the battery. If I ran all LEDs at full power the lights would not display their true color. For instance, bright white became very warm. To adjust for this I run all LEDs at most 50% of optimal brightness to save on energy. This provided to be plenty bright enough in a dim lit room. The inconsistent voltage pattern interference caused a flickering of the lights. To adjust for this I decided to add a jitter of life to the lights. Each light was given a certain threshold of brightness. Every pass of the program the lights are assigned to increase or decrease their brightness by a randomly generated number within the threshold. This causes the illusion that every light is getting slightly larger or smaller as if the cube is jittering with life.

 After being able to play with the cube for a while during testing I needed to start refining the experience. The acrylic, at larger size, was a little more malleable and didn’t feel as soft and the cavity of the cube had a plastic sounding echo. I needed to deaden the echo and make the cube feel more solid. To accomplish this I added a foam buffer between the plates and the cage.

The final details were cleaning up the circuitry and figuring out a way to power the cube on and off. There are a wide variety of power switches. Toggle switches, switches with lights, button switches, large switches, small switches, but I needed my switch to make sense. While opening an apartment garage I saw a keyhole and remembered that there are key driven electric power switches. I instantly ran home, researched, and found a distributor that supplied them. 

I enjoyed the idea of a key power switch because it touches on some of the questions I was attempting to illicit during this interaction. The social ideas behind keys are ideas of importance, or possibly hiding, storing, or keeping something safe. Should you interact with this cube? What will happen when you turn the key? Turning a key is also a much more interactive approach at a switch as well as it forces hand eye coordination and takes a little bit longer than just pushing a button.

![Figure 55. Detail of power switch with keys inserted ](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_079_image_0001.jpg "Figure 55. Detail of power switch with keys inserted ")

The cube sits on a low base and this is intentional. I wanted to force the engaged to move, manipulate, and contort themselves through space before reaching the cube. This forces them to be engaged, make decisions, and be aware. A few concepts of how the bas would be created were explored before landing on the final design. 

A preferred idea spawned from a found, pre cut wood cookie–*log*. Personal beliefs that we should be resourceful often drive me to incorporate found objects into my designs. In this case as, it also provided the perfect, and substantial, connection to nature I was looking for. However, this piece weighed a significant amount and it was not feasible to transport. After a series of failed attempts at boring out the middle to relieve some of its weight, I moved on to the next idea.

![Figure 58. The hoped-to-be wood cookie base for the Interactive Selfie Cube](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_081_image_0001.jpg "Figure 58. The hoped-to-be wood cookie base for the Interactive Selfie Cube")

Still wanting to integrate the idea of nature into the stand, I found inspiration in board formed concrete. It provides a great mix of industry and nature, rigid structure, and its visual and textural qualities blend well with the cubes skin of acrylic and hardware. Using some found palette wood, I pieced together a mold with the pieces possessing the greatest texture. I made sure to collage these pieces together in a way providing visual interest and contrast. 

Once the mold was complete I needed to make sure the concrete mixture would be strong and smooth. This would be necessary as I was planning to make a 16”x16”x2” slab. I chose the 16” dimensions because it is double the size of the cube. I chose 2” as I didn’t want the form to become too heavy and I hoped 2” would be strong enough. I had created 2” molds in the past.

![Figure 59. Detail of board form wood mold for concrete stand creation attempt ](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_082_image_0001.jpg "Figure 59. Detail of board form wood mold for concrete stand creation attempt ")

After preparing and pouring the mold, the time came to wait. I vibrated bubbles out of the mixture and left the concrete to dry and cure. 16 hours later I took a look. The slab had a crack, in the middle, across its entire length. The mold did not work. A few assumptions were it had dried too fast or 2” was not thick enough to support itself. I have different ideas to help strengthen, and lighten, concrete molds in the future. But for now, due to time constraints, it was time to move on to the final fail-safe option.

![Figure 62. Cured concrete upside down on board form wood mold after failed attempt](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_084_image_0001.jpg "Figure 62. Cured concrete upside down on board form wood mold after failed attempt")

The final option was to simply integrate sensors on to a square piece of treated wood. I was able to acquire a nice sheet of plywood already cut to size. After some time finishing the wood by sanding and applying a very light stain to keep its natural look the base was completed and functional. I made sure to integrate hardware as functional pieces into the base as well to create visual connections between the base and the cubes treatment. Large bolts provide both adjustable legs to stand the piece off of the grade and to support the proximity sensors. Special bolts were placed into the wood to provide a finished looking whole that the sensors cables could be dropped through.

![Figure 63. Final wood base created as a stand for the Interactive Selfie Cube](/img/i-can-so-i-will-now-we-must_-a-creative-response-to-selfie-cultu_page_085_image_0001.jpg "Figure 63. Final wood base created as a stand for the Interactive Selfie Cube")

The proximity sensors were added to make up for some of the processing limitations found in the cube. Since the cube interaction lacks the ability to send as many control variables as I had hoped, the proximity sensors would make up. While a user is interacting with the cube they are now encouraged to walk around the base. As they walk around and pass the proximity sensors this will provide a way for them to move through space in the interface. For example, depending upon how close you stand to one of the proximity sensors it will determine how fast you move left on screen.

A final addition to the interface was sonification. I wanted to create a multisensory experience, which included auditory feedback. By using influence from my previous response called Sounds of Twitter I was able to implement a system that creates sounds. The system uses the text data included with each selfie to synthesize sounds. The way this is accomplished is through converting characters to their ASCII values. 
The first letter of each word creates a tone. This tone is carried out until the next word is reached. While this tone is being played each consecutive character also plays a tone. Each tone is played at a set beat. The use of sonification not only adds depth and mood but it is created by the data itself, therefore, creating and informing the experience by the experience itself. 

The cube and interface consist of six modes during the interaction. There is an initial sleep mode. When the cube is first turned on or when no one has interacted with it for a while it will default to sleep mode, a less exploratory more serene state. The lights in the cube are pure white and lightly pulse as if it is breathing. The interface displays selfies very small in a large three-dimensional grid slowly floating around space as if you are in a galaxy of twinkling selfies. 

The five other alternate modes are activated depending on what side the cube is oriented on consisting of flat, top, bottom, left, or right. Each mode has a specific color that the cube and the visuals animate to, in unison, each time the mode is changed. Each mode change has its own variation of how large the selfies are, how spaced out the selfies are, and how much effects on the generated sound is applied. Following this are a series of final photographs taken of the cube in its different stats as well as screen shots of the interface in its different states.
