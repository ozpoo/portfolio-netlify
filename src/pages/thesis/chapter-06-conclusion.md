## 6.1. Summary

Selfies are being posted at an unprecedented level, Online Social Networks are growing more popular every day, and technology continues to advance at an exponential rate. As these parameters continue to be true, the conversation of defining self will continue to evolve. As for now, there is a definite relationship between physical self and online self. 

By performing a range of experimentation in interfacing and data collection, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the limitations interfaces and data sources may exhibit. An interface can inhibit certain ways of viewing information. Through this, the perception of the information is altered and can misinform–*or at least alter*–our interpretation of that data. If this is true, then it must be true that the interpretation of our online self is open to being misinformed–*or altered*–as well. 

The results of this creative response show that the online social network users of Instagram have developed a system under the hashtag of selfie (#selfie). A system that allows the user to expand, develop, and even create an online version of self. This online self, developed through the user's interactions, is seen as a reflection of their physical self, therefore blurring the lines of reality. Or at least changing the way we must look at reality. What we do in the physical world is not what we do online. It can’t be, it was done in the physical world and is seen, at best, merely as a representation of the event through an online post. These representations are designed and planned by the user. A biased view of who or what they believe they are, posted for what may be an eternity. An eternity of reinforcing views and in turn forwarding the definition of a *self informed by technology*.

*Man makes technology, technology makes man, and the dance continues…*

### Guiding Question One

*In what ways are people engaging with Online Social Networks to develop a deeper sense of self?* 

It was found that, specific to Instagram, users who post selfies are engaging in a universal visual language. This visual language is a means of self-defining activity. In other words, they are adopting their Instagram profiles as an extension of self in a way that provides them the ability to present a variety of ideas, associations, emotions, and much more to their followers as an attempt at building self. Building the self they want to be, the self they think they want to be, the self they want people to see, and the self they think they want people to see. 

*Life Experience + Online Social Network Interactions = Self* 

With this visual language defined, I believe we can now take a deeper look into what the language means. Are there connections to the people who are posting these selfies and the types of selfies they decide to post? Can we predict behaviors? Can we predict dysfunctions? Does it make a statement to the direction society is currently moving? 

### Guiding Question Two 

*Do alternative methods of viewing media posted to Online Social networks offer a different perspective of their message?*

The creative responses I exercised showed a variety of new methods we can use to view Online Social Networks. Within those different methods, it was only natural a new perspective could be gained. An observed change in perspective was the ability to pick up on otherwise unseen patterns. One specific pattern was the universal visual language of selfies stated before. However, I also became aware of other seemingly viral patterns such as the nude selfie and the massive use of the hashtag selfie (#selfie) as a means of consumer advertisement. 

### Guiding Question Three 

*Do alternative methods of interacting with media posted to Online Social networks offer a different perspective of their message?* 

The act of multisensory interaction heightens our ability to understand, obtain, and retain knowledge. I cannot speak to what each individual’s specific shift in perspective will be due to interacting with an Online Social network in a different manner. However, I can say the shift will be there. Through my own personal interactions and those who I was able to observe during interaction with the cube I noticed an increase in attention to detail. There was a heightened ability to quickly notice specific attributes in each selfie. Attention to detail is a stepping-stone to fostering deeper thought and forwarding connection and understanding. 

## 6.2. Future Opportunities 

During the exploration I became aware of many other issues in the realm of physical and online self-integration and data storage. Below I have listed and expanded on the initial thoughts of some of the directions I find promising for future exploration.

### Traits and Categorization 

The categorical findings of the selfie study pose an interesting question of their connectedness to personality traits or deeper psychological connections. Do the people posting certain selfies tend towards similar personality traits or psychological dispositions? If so, does this make them more or less vulnerable to negative outcomes of online social networking like narcissism, misinformed representation of self, or other negative effects on psychological well-being? 

### Integration Etiquette 

Expanding on misinterpretation of self, there seems to be a disconnect of proper etiquette when integrating the physical and online self. How do you or don’t you acknowledge what you have done online with your relationships in the physical world? Is it ok to mention what you saw or posted on someone's feed? Should we be worried about specific types of posts? Do specific types of posts trend towards certain types of interactions? In the physical world we have old wives’ tales like “don’t swim for an hour after you eat” and the golden rule. What are the wise tales and golden rules for physical and online self-integration? 

### Misinterpretation of Online Profile 

Do people misinterpret the way others perceive their online profiles? If so, how and what does that change when attempting to integrate physical and online self? Do people misinterpret the motivation or effects that making certain posts has on how they perceive and define themselves? 

### Reverse Data Mapping 

Is it possible to create a map that charts where all data is mirrored? If so, what would the ramifications be in terms of our ability to control, manipulate, or change this data. How would being able to confidently track and remove data from the grid change the way the Internet is used or the way users are willing to interact with it?
